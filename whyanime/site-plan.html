      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Our goal is to create a place where sterotypes and stigmas no longer exist. A community where the
        majority is seen rather than the extremes. Anime is an artistic style of storytelling that is beloved
        by many, yet there seem to be a large majority who have never even given it a chance. We intend to
        properly demonstrate the appeal in order to educate the ignorant and help bring peace to those who feel
        alone in their interests.
      </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The target audience is both males and females from the age range of 14-32. We are looking to appeal
        to those who are old enough that they start to develop their social skills and young enough that they
        may not yet have the responsibility and a family. The target audience is in this range because we are
        looking for those who enjoy anime and are in a situation that they may want to introduce their friends
        to it as well. That demographic seems to be the most densely populated for those that both watch anime 
        and choose to spend more of their time around friends rather than family.

        Japanese animation, more commonly referred to as “anime”, has been a popular genre of an artistic style 
        of storytelling originating as far back as the early 1900's. Although Japanese animation has always had 
        influence in the Americas, it has exploded in popularity since 2020, largely due to quarantining as a 
        result of COVID 19. When the world entered a social distancing period and underwent a lockdown, many of 
        us turned to technology and media in order to keep ourselves entertained, discovering new forms of 
        entertainment. One such form of entertainment was anime. As you navigate this website, hopefully we are
        educate you on what exactly anime is and why you WILL want to watch it.

      <h3>Anime vs Live Action</h3>
      <p>
        It is no secret that animation is typically associated with children shows and movies giving animation 
        a bad connotation; however, there are some storytelling styles and thematic elements that can be hard 
        to achieve in a live action production. For example, have you ever watched a movie with bad CGI or 
        totally obvious green screening? Did that out-of-the-ordinary-look take away from the movie at all? 
        Did it elicit some sort of negative response from you as the viewer? If so, then you experienced the 
        downfall of live action television. We observe the world and record in our brain our observations every 
        day. We, as people, internalize all that we see and when the effect of a movie is very apparent that it 
        is fake, it takes us out of that story. Marvel is an excellent example of when we see some fantasy exist 
        in an alternate reality to ours. Although we know that a man should not be able to turn into a green 
        giant monster, because we observe that it interacts with an environment that is similar to ours, our 
        brain can accept that as real in another universe. When not done well though, we can see it and have 
        a hard time believing in that story. Anime does not have this downfall. Anime is not a world we live in 
        and therefore there are very few things we can witness in an anime that would lead us to believe it is 
        fake. Teeth turning into spikes, faces turning red from embarrassment, body and limbs changing shape. 
        These are a few artistic elements that compliment the narrative of the story. These visuals help the 
        viewer to gain a sense of how that character is feeling. There is little confusion and because there 
        is no concern for being taken out of the plot, it is easier to become more emotionally invested.

      <h3>Popular Anime</h3>
      <p>
        When talking about the most popular anime it is important to mention what is considered to be the father 
        of anime, “Dragon Ball”. The Dragon Ball series is considered to be the father of anime because it was 
        the first to have widespread popularity across the globe. You may have heard of Dragon Ball or Dragon 
        Ball Z  once already. It would be weird to not have heard of it at least once because for many it was 
        their first introduction into anime. From there we have “The Big Three”. The Big Three is a group of three 
        anime that dominated the industry for years where the manga sales and anime adaptations were top sellers 
        for decades. The three are “Naruto”, “Bleach”, and “One Piece”. Once again, you may have heard of one of 
        these three already. For many, these may have been someone's introduction into anime as well. Because of 
        the timeline for the release and runtime of these anime you could make the argument that Dragon Ball was 
        the first generation wave of anime influence and the Big Three to be the second. There has been a debate 
        about whether or not there has been a resurgence of a third wave. A new generation of anime that has taken 
        over pop culture. “My Hero Academia”, “JuJutsu Kaisen”, “Attack on Titan”, or “Demon Slayer” to name a 
        few. With many of those titles appearing in theater releases and achieving a top 10 series ranking on IMDB, 
        next to series like “Breaking Bad”, it is undeniable that these newer generation anime have been gaining 
        more traction in the US than ever before.
