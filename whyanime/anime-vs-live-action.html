            <p> It is no secret that animation is typically associated with children shows and movies giving animation 
                a bad connotation; however, there are some storytelling styles and thematic elements that can be hard 
                to achieve in a live action production. For example, have you ever watched a movie with bad CGI or 
                totally obvious green screening? Did that out-of-the-ordinary-look take away from the movie at all? 
                Did it elicit some sort of negative response from you as the viewer? If so, then you experienced the 
                downfall of live action television. We observe the world and record in our brain our observations every 
                day. We, as people, internalize all that we see and when the effect of a movie is very apparent that it 
                is fake, it takes us out of that story. Marvel is an excellent example of when we see some fantasy exist 
                in an alternate reality to ours. Although we know that a man should not be able to turn into a green 
                giant monster, because we observe that it interacts with an environment that is similar to ours, our 
                brain can accept that as real in another universe. When not done well though, we can see it and have 
                a hard time believing in that story. Anime does not have this downfall. Anime is not a world we live in 
                and therefore there are very few things we can witness in an anime that would lead us to believe it is 
                fake. Teeth turning into spikes, faces turning red from embarrassment, body and limbs changing shape. 
                These are a few artistic elements that compliment the narrative of the story. These visuals help the 
                viewer to gain a sense of how that character is feeling. There is little confusion and because there 
                is no concern for being taken out of the plot, it is easier to become more emotionally invested.</p>
