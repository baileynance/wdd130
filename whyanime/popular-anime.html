            <h1 class="p3h1 title-box">Popular Anime</h1>
            <p class="p3p1 paragraph">When talking about the most popular anime it is important to mention what is considered to be the father 
                of anime, “Dragon Ball”. The Dragon Ball series is considered to be the father of anime because it was 
                the first to have widespread popularity across the globe. You may have heard of Dragon Ball or Dragon 
                Ball Z  once already. It would be weird to not have heard of it at least once because for many it was 
                their first introduction into anime. From there we have “The Big Three”. The Big Three is a group of three 
                anime that dominated the industry for years where the manga sales and anime adaptations were top sellers 
                for decades. The three are “Naruto”, “Bleach”, and “One Piece”. Once again, you may have heard of one of 
                these three already.</p>
            <img class="movie-theater-img" src="images/movietheater.jpg" alt="Movie Theater">
            <p class="p3p2 paragraph">For many, these may have been someone's introduction into anime as well. Because of 
                the timeline for the release and runtime of these anime you could make the argument that Dragon Ball was 
                the first generation wave of anime influence and the Big Three to be the second. There has been a debate 
                about whether or not there has been a resurgence of a third wave. A new generation of anime that has taken 
                over pop culture. “My Hero Academia”, “JuJutsu Kaisen”, “Attack on Titan”, or “Demon Slayer” to name a 
                few. With many of those titles appearing in theater releases and achieving a top 10 series ranking on IMDB, 
                next to series like “Breaking Bad”, it is undeniable that these newer generation anime have been gaining 
                more traction in the US than ever before.</p>
